<p>The Common Criteria (CC) in the Cloud (CCitC) Technical Community has developed this guidance document to provide a complimentary approach that allows for IT product evaluations in cloud operational environments. It includes instructions and examples of how to extend or develop Protection Profiles (PPs) for Target of Evaluation (TOE) deployments in cloud environments. This effort does not replace service-oriented frameworks or Cloud Authorization schemes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The intended audience of this document are Protection Profile authors (e.g. iTCs and national TCs), but it may also be useful for cloud service providers, evaluators, evaluation authorities (schemes), labs, customers, and other stakeholders of these types of products. The expectations for the roles above are further discussed in section <a href="#_roles_clarification">Roles Clarification</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guidance introduces several concepts necessary to facilitate CCitC evaluations such as the trusted platform, as well as provides guidance to CC testing laboratories and CC schemes. However, it primarily covers three general areas:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When conducting Common Criteria evaluations for IT products in cloud environments, it is crucial to recognize that the Target of Evaluation (TOE) may be presented in a variety of deployment models. TOE products can be specifically designed to operate within the cloud natively, utilizing services and constructs that are only available within the cloud environment. They can also be deployed as self-contained products that are simply hosted on cloud infrastructure, otherwise known as “lift and shift." They may be a hybrid of both methods. The TOE will typically fall within the three primary cloud architecture models: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To further advance this concept, the following cloud architectures may be composed of Protection Profiles that are extended for a cloud context as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_software_as_a_service_saas">Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This topology enables the SaaS Application (TOE) to run on cloud infrastructure where it is accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The TOE does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage.</p>

<h2 id="_shared_security_model">Shared Security Model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the realm of cloud security, the shared security model is a fundamental concept that defines the division of responsibilities between the CSP and their customers within a cloud environment. This model generally provides that the CSP is responsible for securing the underlying cloud infrastructure, the customer bears the responsibility of securing their applications, data, and configurations within said infrastructure based on the service model. The shared security model recognizes that security is a collaborative effort, where both the CSP and the customer play crucial roles. This model is widely embraced in various cloud security frameworks, as it provides a clear model for understanding and allocating security responsibilities in a cloud environment. By delineating these responsibilities, the shared security model helps establish trust, accountability, and transparency between the CSP and the customer, ensuring a holistic approach to cloud security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This concept is useful for CCitC evaluations as well and mirrors the relationship found with the TOE and TOE platform. To emphasize the enhanced requirements for Cloud Infrastructure we will refer to the shared responsibility model in terms of the TOE and the <a href="#_trusted_platform">Trusted Platform</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_responsibilities">Responsibilities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the majority of use cases, the TOE administrator (the customer) is responsible for the secure utilization and customization of the cloud services provided by the CSP. This includes managing user access controls, configuring security settings, and implementing appropriate security measures aligned with their specific requirements. These elements may map appropriately to existing SFRs such as management functions defined by the FMT class in CC Part 2 (FMT_SMF) with or without refinement for CCitC. The TOE administrator ensures that the TOE (cloud tenant) operates securely within the parameters set by the CSP (TOE platform).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the CSP maintains the security and availability of the TOE platform, the TOE administrator (customer) is assumed to be tasked with safeguarding their applications, data, and configurations within the cloud environment. They actively manage security controls, such as authentication mechanisms, encryption protocols, and network access policies, to protect their assets and mitigate potential risks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The evaluation and assessment of the shared security model must consider both the TOE administrator (customer) and the TOE platform (CSP). The CSP, as the TOE platform, undergoes evaluation against relevant security standards, certifications, and best practices to demonstrate the effectiveness of the underlying cloud infrastructure&#8217;s security controls. See the <a href="#_trusted_platform">Trusted Platform</a> section for more information on the required security assessments for the TOE platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simultaneously, the TOE administrator (customer) is responsible for implementing and managing security controls and configurations within their own cloud environment. They utilize the provided security features, adhere to the CSP&#8217;s policies and guidelines, and maintain appropriate security configurations to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_evaluation_of_the_shared_security_model">Evaluation of the Shared Security Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are certain areas where the shared security model can be somewhat blurred. For example, with many CC evaluations, the TOE or TOE Security Functional Interface (TSFI) is expected to exclusively generate TOE audit events. In the context of a virtualized network device deployed on a public cloud, certain CC requirements, such as FAU_GEN.1 (Audit Generation), may need to be modified to account for the use of logs provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FAU_GEN.1 requires the TOE (virtualized network device) to generate audit records for security-relevant events. However, in a cloud environment, the CSP typically manages the underlying infrastructure and maintains centralized logging systems. As a result, the TOE may rely on the CSP&#8217;s log management capabilities and use the logs provided by the CSP rather than generating its own audit records.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, to accommodate this scenario, the cPP for the virtualized network device on the public cloud should specify the requirements for log usage from the CSP&#8217;s logging infrastructure. This would include defining the format, content, and frequency of logs to be provided by the CSP. Additionally, the cPP should address the integrity and confidentiality of these logs during transmission and storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The modified CC requirements would then focus on the TOE&#8217;s capability to securely receive, process, and analyze the logs provided by the CSP. The TOE should be able to extract relevant security events from the logs and correlate them with its own internal security policies. Furthermore, it should have the ability to raise alerts or initiate appropriate actions based on the analysis of the logs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By adapting CC requirements like FAU_GEN.1 to encompass log consumption from the CSP, the protection profile enables the virtualized network device to leverage the logging capabilities provided by the CSP while maintaining compliance with CC requirements. This ensures that security-relevant events are properly logged, analyzed, and acted upon in the cloud environment, contributing to a comprehensive security posture for the virtualized network device.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, it may be important to add a third element to the shared security model for CCitC evaluations. This would be the inclusion of the TOE developer in addition to the TOE administrator and CSP. The TOE developer may be responsible for providing TOE security updates, maintaining a trusted update channel and infrastructure, or even applying these updates on behalf of the TOE administrator. This is a common feature with traditional SaaS use cases. In such cases where a TOE developer is expected to share responsibilities in the security model, PP authors must make the appropriate refinements, additions, or iterations of related elements in their PPs. This is a scenario that may be more common in TOE types that are meant to incorporate physical hardware into Cloud Infrastructure such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM). However, CCitC evaluations are not limited to a particular deployment model. Additionally, it is expected that there will be evaluations of TOEs that are integral to a CSPs cloud stack from hardware to application layers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_administrator_guidance_documentation_agd">Administrator Guidance Documentation (AGD)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, by designating the customer as the TOE administrator, the shared security model reinforces their active involvement in the secure administration of the cloud services. The CSP, as the TOE platform, provides the underlying infrastructure, while the TOE administrator assumes the responsibility of effectively configuring, managing, and monitoring the TOE to meet their specific security objectives and compliance requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ensure that TOE administrators who are familiar with Common Criteria, but may have limited knowledge of cloud infrastructure and security can effectively manage the TOE within the shared security model. Therefore, it is important for PP authors to adapt the AGD requirements accordingly. This includes providing clear instructions, accessible language, and practical guidance tailored to TOE administrators to help bridge the gap between Common Criteria expertise and the challenges of managing security in a cloud environment. This is further described in the <a href="#_determine_impact_on_sars">Determine Impact on SARs</a> section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_security_target_ase">Security Target (ASE)</h3>

<p>Additionally, the Security Target (ST) ASE requirements can be modified by PP authors to provide clear explanations that are tailored to evaluator&#8217;s limited knowledge of cloud infrastructure and security. Such modifications may be appropriate for the  TOE Summary Specification (TSS) requirements and should include detailed information such that it is clear how the TSFI or Security Functional Requirement (SFR) enforcing features interact with the TOE platform in a cloud context.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While there may be functional differences between a TOE and a TOE platform in a cloud OE, the relationship between the two in providing SFR enforcing functionality does not change for cloud-based evaluations. In cloud scenarios, the TOE platform does require a hosting environment provided by the trusted platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, there may be cases that may require PP authors to provide additional selections for invoking either the TOE platform or the trusted platform for SFR enforcing functionality.</p>

<h2 id="_scheme_guidance">Scheme Guidance</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scheme evaluation authorities should carefully review this guidance for any PP that is being used for an evaluation of a TOE in a cloud environment and confirm that there are no conflicts with existing evaluation authority policies. For example, a requirement for the evaluator to have the the TOE physically located or tested in their own facility. Although physical control is not practical for cloud evaluations, this does not mean that the lab is not in control of the cloud testing environment. If a lab provisions cloud platforms for testing, the appropriate controls for accreditation can be extended to their cloud testing environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CC Schemes should consider writing their own policies regarding trusted platform acceptance criteria in order to support the evaluation efforts. A given PP should provide guidance for an evaluator to assess whether the cloud environment for the TOE satisfies the security objectives of the OE. This may likely include a mapping to cloud authorization schemes that the evaluation authority may recognize as providing assurance that the security objective for the OE are met, and may provide input for a scheme&#8217;s policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Schemes should review the evaluator evidence regarding the establishment of their cloud testing environment. This evidence should demonstrate that its environment establishes controls provided by the CSP to ensure effective isolation equivalent to on-prem testing thereby maintaining the integrity of results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scheme should review the PPs guidance around vulnerability testing as well and confirm that the evaluator has considered that guidance. The evaluator evidence should demonstrate that the evaluator was able to use cloud attack vectors. (e.g. service portal, management plane, etc. to complete the testing).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, guidance for penetration testing should be given with the understanding that the TOE may not be deployed in a fully closed environment and as such there may be limitations on the rules of engagement that must be followed with the CSP. It is expected that evaluation schemes will provide guidance on the penetration test efforts that will be accepted for cloud evaluations, and PP authors should incorporate such guidance into PPs for consistency.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_guidance_for_evaluators">Guidance for Evaluators</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A PP should provide an evaluator with clear explanations tailored to an evaluator&#8217;s perhaps limited experience of cloud infrastructure and security. Evaluators should aim to develop their knowledge and techniques for TOEs in the cloud to a comparable level to that for traditional on-prem TOEs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Evaluators should read the PP’s explicit guidance for TOEs in a cloud environment. This should include a mapping that an evaluator should use to confirm that a cloud authorization Scheme validated the selected trusted platform to have controls fulfilling the assumptions and associated security objectives for the operational environment. This will likely include a mapping that may be used by an evaluator to confirm that the selected trusted platform has been validated by an appropriate cloud authorization scheme to have controls fulfilling the assumptions and associated security objectives for the operational environment. This material should be reviewed and considered carefully. In the case where an evaluator considers that the material provided is insufficient or in error, the evaluator should contact the PP author for further discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Evaluators should consider guidance in the protection profile regarding testing. An evaluator should prepare cloud testing infrastructure for the evaluation. This environment will establish controls provided by the CSP to ensure effective isolation to maintain the integrity of results. This may involve isolated Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Access Control Lists (ACL), Compute Resources, etc. on multi-tenant infrastructure. This information will need to be captured and presented to evaluation authorities as evaluation deliverables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Evaluators should also consider vulnerability testing guidance in the PP. It may be the case that when applicable vulnerabilities are discovered or suspected for TOEs operating in a cloud environment, the evaluators may be required to use cloud attack vectors.

<p>When deploying a TOE to public cloud infrastructure, proper identification and distinction of the TOE instances are crucial. This ensures accurate tracking, management, and application of security controls specific to each TOE instance within the cloud environment. In this section, we will explain how TOE identification can be established when deploying TOE instances on popular public cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This is not meant to be an exhaustive list and in the future may be expanded.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing Security Targets, the Cloud Service Offering (CSO) must be detailed in the TOE evaluated configuration and shall include the cloud region and/or applicable datacenter. CSOs offered by the same CSP cannot inherently be assumed to be equivalent. For instance, CSPs may have separate environments among government or commercial customers with differing security capabilities. Therefore, an equivalency rationale must be made to claim multiple CSO compatibility with the evaluated configuration. However, if cloud authorizations exist for multiple regions or datacenters in which a CSO is found to meet similar requirements constistently this may be leveraged as equivalency rationale. In addition, each CC scheme has the option to define a policy for acceptance criteria.</p>

<h3 id="_cpu_equivalency">CPU Equivalency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In evaluating IT products within a cloud context, precision and consistency in labeling OEs are of paramount importance. This section outlines the essential guidelines for labeling OEs according to the specific characteristics of the technology stack involved. This guidance aligns with the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applicable guidance shall be followed when labeling OEs such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TOE version XX.YY on OS version X.Y on CPU model Z</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TOE version XX.YY on Hypervisor version X.Y on CPU model Z</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TOE version XX.YY on Hypervisor version X.Y on OS version X.Y on CPU model Z</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TOEs that are being evaluated in a cloud context are expected to be able to conclusively demonstrate knowledge of the underlying TOE platform for these specifics. If SFR enforcing functionality is agnostic to the TOE platform, such equivalency claims may be made, for example when all entropy is utilizing a Jitter entropy source which exists only in the OS User Space. However, if the TOE is relying on the TOE platform for any SFR enforcing functionality, then the TOE must be able to conclusively demonstrate knowledge of the underlying TOE platform for this functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a TOE is reliant on the OE for cryptographic operations, there is no need to leverage collateral, such as cryptographic module validations, that explicitly states operation for a Cloud Provider. This equivalence rationale should be considered when a TOE developer is reliant upon a CSP for algorithm certification and many TOE platforms are claimed.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this writing, most existing PPs within the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA), do not currently define cloud use cases.

For example, with respect to the NDcPP, the existing security problem definition and environmental security objectives may not cover the case where a network device is deployed as a cloud platform or infrastructure device. The potential cloud use cases for individual product types must be considered as part of determining a PP’s suitability for supporting cloud evaluations. In the case of national PPs, it is recommended that PP authors consult with product vendors for the technology type to determine  whether cloud use cases exists.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different nations use different standards, methodologies, and assessment schemes for approval of cloud infrastructure, platforms, and software. This may tie into more general security controls that can be examined. For example, the U.S. standard NIST SP 800-53 defines security controls for information systems across physical, personnel, procedural, and technical domains. The FedRAMP authorization process ensures that cloud infrastructure, platforms, and software can be deployed in a manner that satisfies the 800-53 security controls that the program considers to be relevant to cloud systems. FedRAMP defines Low, Moderate, and High assessment baselines with hierarchical controls. In the MDM example discussed throughout this document, FedRAMP will be used as the cloud authorization scheme for reference.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this exercise is to attempt to answer the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the environment where the TOE is deployed capable of meeting the assumptions for the operational environment that the PP or PP-Module defines? That is, if the TOE is deployed on a platform or infrastructure that has been ‘certified’ through some separate cloud authorization program, is that sufficient to say the OE is suitable for CC, or would additional assurances be needed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any obvious gaps in the PP or PP-Module where requirements or tests would need to be added or modified specifically for the case of a cloud deployment?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once these questions have been answered for a particular cloud evaluation methodology, the idea is that the same logic could be applied to any other such methods that are used by other Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) members.</p>

<h4 id="_identify_the_sfr_impact_on_cloud_deployment">Identify the SFR Impact on Cloud Deployment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each SFR in the PP or PP-Module is likely written in such a way that assumes on-premise deployments are used for the TOE. Analysis of the SFRs and their corresponding evaluation activities must be done to determine the impact of deploying a product in a cloud environment. Specifically:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are there any SFRs that allow “TSF vs TOE platform” selections to be made and if so, does the nature of how the TOE platform implements the function change based on whether the TOE platform is cloud-based versus on-premise? For example, a general-purpose operating system in a cloud environment may rely on data-at-rest protection that is provided by an underlying storage volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any evaluation activities that must be executed differently in a cloud environment, and does this potentially change based on the CSP being used?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, a software application may rely on cryptographic services provided by a host operating system that runs on some physical hardware. When this application runs in a cloud environment, the end user of the application is not responsible for the physical hardware. Therefore, knowledge of the potential hardware that the CSP makes available to the end user must be known so that all possible use cases for hardware processing of cryptographic functions can be assessed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any evaluation activities that cannot be performed as written when the TOE is deployed in a cloud environment, or that can only be performed with special accommodations? For example, Transport Layer Security (TLS) testing requires extensive manipulation of network traffic and a CSP may automatically deploy a traffic filtering firewall that discards invalid traffic before it can even reach the TOE. Depending on the test environment, it may require coordination with the CSP to ensure that the operational environment is configured in such a way that the evaluator can verify that the TOE is performing the required function rather than an environmental component.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If there are any evaluation activities that cannot be performed as written for a cloud evaluation, the PP author must provide alternative guidance for how the evaluation activity may be modified to show that the requirement is adequately met in a cloud environment. The PP author must write any cloud-specific evaluation activities in a manner that is sufficiently generic to be achievable regardless of the CSP being used. Evaluation activities should not implicitly ‘endorse’ a given set of CSPs by virtue of being the only ones for which guidance exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be the case that a requirement simply does not apply to a cloud environment, in which case the PP author could consider defining that requirement as an implementation-based SFR that applies only to the on-premise use case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any critical functions that are missing because of the PP or PP-Module’s current expectation that the TOE is deployed in an on-premise environment? If so, PP authors should work with technical subject matter experts to define implementation-based SFRs that apply only to the cloud use case such that the desired functionality can be covered in this situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that mappings to the desired cloud authorization schemes are not critical here, at least not from a CC perspective. The expectation is that if the TOE has already been validated against a cloud authorization scheme, there will be little to no re-use of that evidence because of how tailored the CC requirements are to specific tests. There may be some value to vendors pursuing cloud certification after a CC evaluation because the specific evidence could be reusable in a more general context, but the relationship likely does not flow both ways.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_determine_appropriateness_of_security_problem_definition">Determine Appropriateness of Security Problem Definition</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Security Problem Definition (SPD) of a PP or PP-Module defines the threats the TOE faces, the assumptions about the TOE’s operational environment that bounds these threats, and any organizational security policies the organization deploying the TOE may implement to help mitigate the threats in a way that the TOE cannot explicitly enforce (e.g. by defining a password policy that is stronger than what the PP or PP-Module requires).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of this activity is to consider what an appropriate operational environment would be for the TOE in a cloud setting based on the assumptions defined in the PP. In the context of cloud evaluations specifically, it is important for the end user to have confidence that these assumptions are adequately met since not all aspects of the operational environment will be in their direct control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To determine the appropriateness of the existing SPD, the PP author should perform the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For each assumption in the PP or PP-Module, determine whether it applies to any cloud-specific use cases. If the assumption is not affected by a cloud deployment, then no further consideration is needed for it.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: If there is an assumption that an environmental component is configured to communicate with the TOE to receive information from it, this is not cloud-specific because an environmental component outside of the cloud is responsible for that configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the assumption does apply to cloud-specific use cases, determine if it is decomposed to the most granular level or it is a more general statement that could be made more granular. It is important to decompose assumptions to their lowest level so that all applicable security controls can be considered in the context of whether a cloud authorization of the environment is sufficient to demonstrate that it can satisfy the assumptions.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: An assumption that the TOE is protected by a network boundary device (e.g. firewall) is granular.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, a general assumption that administrators are non-malicious is not granular because there are several ways in which malicious administration can be safeguarded against. This can be made more granular by further breaking it down into assumptions that privilege escalation by non-administrators is prevented, such as by physical security controls on the infrastructure, adequate credential protection, adequate enforcement of logical data separation mechanisms, and routine penetration testing against the overall system to ensure the continuous authorization of these things. It can also include background checks or other vetting of administrators and split control that requires approval of administrative decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once all the assumptions related to cloud deployments are listed out in their most granular form, review the chosen cloud scheme for any areas of overlap.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: For the non-malicious administrator assumption outlined above and using Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) as the chosen cloud authorization scheme, the following NIST SP 800-53 controls that are used in FedRAMP can be used to show that those assumptions are met by the environment:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Credential protection: IA-5, part of FedRAMP Low</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical protection: PE-1 through PE-4, part of FedRAMP Low (1 through 3) and Moderate (4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical data separation: SC-4, part of FedRAMP Moderate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penetration testing: CA-8, part of FedRAMP Moderate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background checks: PS-3, part of FedRAMP High</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split control: AC-3(2), not part of any FedRAMP baseline</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal here should be to make a statement that asserts whether an existing cloud authorization program is sufficient to validate that the cloud portion of the TOE’s operational environment is a “trusted platform” or whether it would need to be supplemented with additional evidence. Additionally, if the chosen authorization program has multiple levels, types, or other distinguishing factors, the relevant one should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: FedRAMP High plus supplementing with NIST control AC-3(2) would be needed to provide assurance that the trusted administrator assumption would be met in the TOE’s chosen operational environment, based on the analysis above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the context of software, if one reviews the SPD and can determine that all assumptions on the operational environment are covered by 800-53 security controls that are assessed as part of the FedRAMP Moderate baseline, they could assert that using platform and infrastructure components certified against this baseline would be sufficient to conclude that the chosen operational environment is suitable. In the case of a platform, the same process could be followed, except that only the infrastructure would need to be examined since that is the operational environment for the platform. Lastly, in the case of infrastructure, the non-technical aspects of the underlying cloud service provider (physical, personnel, and procedural controls), typically provided by a trusted platform, must be consistent for the suitability of the operational environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many PP assumptions are similar if not identical among PPs. For example, assumptions regarding trusted administrators or physical protection of the TOE are generally present in PPs with very similar wording among them. The MDM PP is no exception. The decomposition and mappings done for this PP could potentially be usable in other PPs without needing to come up with separate rationale for what is essentially the same process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, there are some assumptions (addressed by operational environment objectives) that are specific to cloud environments and do not apply to on-premise use cases. Existing PPs, therefore, do not have any reference to these since they were not written with cloud evaluations in mind. The CCitC technical community has compiled some sample assumptions and environmental objectives that could be considered for inclusion in PPs that support cloud evaluations; these are listed in <a href="#Appendix A">[Appendix A]</a> below. Note that this approach is similar to the NDcPP, which has assumptions and environmental security objectives that only apply in certain situations, such as when the TOE is distributed or when the TOE is virtualized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the shared security model must be considered when looking at assumptions. Responsibility for secure deployment and configuration of the TOE may involve collaboration of up to four different groups (infrastructure vendor, platform vendor, software vendor, and end user). The roles and responsibilities must be considered on a PP or PP-Module level because the trusted personnel will differ based on what layer of the cloud stack the TOE sits on. This may vary from vendor to vendor or from product to product. For example, a CSP deploying its own software on its own cloud infrastructure may only have a single point of contact on its end and there are no cross-organizational concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_determine_impact_on_sars">Determine Impact on SARs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the number and level of SARs can vary widely depending on the scheme or organization authoring the PPs and PP-Configurations, the SARs from the MDM PP can serve as an initial minimal baseline for how a cloud evaluation affects the evidence that laboratories will be expected to produce. The extent to which a cloud evaluation affects this evidence is not expected to vary by technology type, but further analysis of individual PPs would be needed to confirm this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, when the TOE is evaluated in the cloud against the MDM PP, additional installation guidance may be needed for initial deployment in a given CSP. However, this is expected to be true of other PPs as well and not something that only affects MDM products specifically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process was followed for the MDM PP to determine how evaluation activities for its SARs would be affected in the case where a TOE is evaluated in the cloud. The following are considerations for PP authors on how to incorporate cloud evaluation guidance into SAR evaluation activities:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Class ASE (Security Target) – PP authors should make it clear that any cloud-based evaluation of the TOE should clearly state the operational environment in which the TOE was tested to the greatest degree that is feasible. This is expected to include the claimed CSPs, regions, and hardware machine pools where applicable. If the CSP has functionality that the TOE relies on to support the enforcement of its security claims, such as data-at-rest protection, these should be referenced in the physical boundary of the TOE as security-relevant interfaces to the cloud.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On an individual SFR level, if the method by which the TOE meets an SFR differs when it is being evaluated in the cloud, the PP author must ensure that evaluation activities have appropriate guidance for what the Security Target needs to document when making these claims. Any implementation-based SFRs that are only claimed when the TOE is evaluated in the cloud or only when it is evaluated on-premise must also indicate clearly when those SFRs are expected to apply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class ADV (Development) – Since the TOE’s evaluation in the cloud may rely on other cloud services to support the enforcement of the TOE’s claimed security functionality, PP authors should ensure that discussions on the TOE’s interfaces to the cloud are described in the context of the functional specification. If the required ADV SARs include a TOE design specification or architectural description, PP authors should provide guidance as to what is necessary to document about how the cloud version of the TOE differs from a traditional on-premise architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class AGD (Guidance) – Preparatory procedures will differ significantly between cloud-based and on-premise TOEs. The PP author must provide guidance for the preparatory procedures that are needed for the TOE to be deployed in its claimed cloud environments. This may involve separate sections for separate CSPs if multiple CSPs are claimed in the evaluated configuration. The guidance may assume that the intended reader has basic familiarity with deploying cloud products; the PP author’s focus should be to ensure that developers understand the need for the guidance to instruct users on how to replicate the evaluated configuration to the greatest extent possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class ALC (Lifecycle) – The TOE and its operational environment cannot be assumed to be static in a cloud environment. Identification of both the TOE and its operational environment is critical for the user to understand the tradeoffs among compliance with the evaluated configuration of the TOE and any subsequent security or feature enhancements that may be made after it has been certified. PP authors are encouraged to include lifecycle evaluation activities for how the TOE and its environmental dependencies are identified in the evaluated configuration and how updates are delivered both to the TOE and to its underlying operational environment. It may be the case that the CSP is responsible for back-end updates to the TOE’s operational environment. The PP author should emphasize that this be clearly expressed in the life cycle documentation so that the evaluation laboratory can evaluate how the TOE developer takes these environmental changes into consideration when managing the product&#8217;s life cycle and how such changes are communicated to end users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class ATE (Testing) – As discussed previously, functional testing of SFR claims may or may not be different when the TOE is evaluated in the cloud. For cases where on-premise and cloud evaluation of a given SFR may differ, the PP author is expected to provide clear guidance as to the evaluation activities that are different for each use case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class AVA (Vulnerability Analysis) – A vulnerability analysis of a cloud product may involve many dependencies that the TOE relies on in a way that an on-premise TOE may not be able to. Frequent changes to environmental configuration on the CSP side may not be in the control of end users and will continually change the versions of dependent components that the TOE relies upon. PP authors should provide guidance to evaluators to identify the dependencies that the TOE has in the cloud (for each claimed CSP) and conduct vulnerability research on the latest versions of those dependencies, as well as any potential vulnerabilities that are specific to the claimed CSPs. See the <a href="#_scheme_guidance">Scheme Guidance</a> section for specific suggestions regarding penetration testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The high-level takeaways from this are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same notion of needing the operational environment to be a “trusted platform” applies here – deploying the TOE in a cloud platform and infrastructure has undergone a third-party authorization is important because it helps the evaluator understand the extent to which the TOE relies on the platform and assures that a vulnerable platform does not introduce any significant potential exploits of the TOE itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of a cloud deployment on how the TOE is evaluated is generally not going to be specific to a particular PP or PP-Configuration; following general CCitC guidance for this should be suitable in most cases.</p>

In the context of the PP’s highlighted, where the assurance level is low (no development security requirements, vulnerability requirements at AVA_VAN.1: public search), the assumptions and Security Objectives for the OE should be sufficiently satisfied by any suitable cloud security certification process recognized by a national government supporting Common Criteria, that addresses the environment being used (e.g. lowest level FedRAMP, BSI C5 baseline, ISO27017).</p>

<p>Conceptually, a PP or PP-Configuration should allow a TOE to be evaluated in a cloud deployment.</p>

<p>However, not all clouds are created equal. Some method is needed to ensure that if the TOE depends on a cloud platform or infrastructure, there is sufficient trust in its security to say they are eligible to be used as the TOE’s operational environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While cloud authorization of the environment is an essential part of gaining sufficient trust to deploy the TOE in a cloud setting, such an authorization of the TOE itself, may only offer minimal value in terms of evidence reuse. This is due to the specific granularity of CC evidence. However, the benefits may flow the opposite direction; due to the high level of rigor of a CC evaluation, the evidence from such a certification could potentially be reused for a higher-level cloud certification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a general level, the CC in the Cloud technical community is developing guidance documentation that should be usable across all  CC cloud evaluations that covers the cloud-specific requirements for operational and preparatory procedures. Such guidance should be applied uniformly across all PPs to ensure consistent presentation across technology types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a per-PP level, technical communities will need to determine several key factors such as:</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The underlying assumptions that the TOE relies on a cloud service provider to satisfy.</p>

<li>
<p>The extent to which existing SFRs can be tested in a cloud setting.</p>

<p>In the case where a TOE is hosted on a trusted platform, platform related Assumptions and associated Security Objectives for the OE should be fulfilled by that trusted platform.</p>

The table provides a mapping between them and also to <a href="#CiscoCCFv2">[CiscoCCFv2]</a>, which provides further mapping to individual cloud authorization schemes.

<p>Threats are not considered here since they map to security objectives for the TOE rather than assumptions and security objectives for the OE.

<p>The TOE is assumed to be physically protected in its Trusted Platform environment and not subject to physical attacks that compromise the security or interfere with the TOE&#8217;s physical interconnections and correct operation. This protection is assumed to be sufficient to protect the TOE and the data it contains. As a result, there are no further requirements on physical tamper protection or other physical attack mitigations. The TOE is not expected to defend against physical access to the TOE that allows unauthorized entities to extract data, bypass other controls, or otherwise manipulate the TOE.</p>

<h3 id="_guidance_documentation">Guidance Documentation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is existing documentation for a CSP it should be leveraged. Each CSP that is tested shall provide instructions for deployment of the TOE. Consultants and vendors shall provide necessary supplemental guidance as it supports deploying the TOE as evaluated in the cloud. In addition, functionality that is included but not evaluated shall be clearly identified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to distinguish here that not all expected elements of a traditional AGD document can be translated for Cloud Environments. It may be necessary to exclude or supplement these guidance requirements depending on the topology of the product and the cloud service provider. In some circumstances, the Cloud Provider is the only entity that may fulfill these guidance requirements to ensure that the TOE is deployed in the tested configuration.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_guidance_for_test_environments_on_cloud_infrastructure">Guidance For Test Environments on Cloud Infrastructure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Common Criteria testing requires isolated test environments for each TOE to prevent contamination of test results, testing on Public Cloud infrastructure raises some unique challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An evaluator should be prepared to create and offer cloud testing infrastructure to TOE developers. This environment must establish controls provided by the CSP to establish effective isolation equivalent to on-prem testing to ensure the integrity of results. This may involve isolated VLANs, ACLs, Compute Resources, etc. on multi-tenant infrastructure. This information will need to be captured and presented to Evaluation Authorities as evaluation deliverables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the necessity to abstract from underlying hardware layers is dictated by the TOE type in Protection Profiles. For instance, the cPP for Application Software relies only on the underlying OS and makes no distinction on whether that OS is virtualized. In this scenario bare metal isolation in the cloud testing would be unnecessary and  a multi-tenancy environment is acceptable.</p>

<p>In general, the AVA methodology shall be sufficient for most TOE types. However, certain edge cases may present themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we have introduced a trusted platform concept, underlying vulnerabilities in the cloud operational environment can be treated as they are in traditional OE analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when applicable vulnerabilities are discovered or suspected for TOEs operating in a cloud environment, the means in which evaluators are expected to shift negative test coverage must use cloud attack vectors. (e.g. service portal, management plane, etc.)</p>

<p>As a way of gaining understanding of how existing PP’s may work within the cloud environment, a ‘composition stack’ of PP’s is considered.</p>

<p>It can be observed that for each PP higher in the stack, it may rely on security services that may or may not be provided by PP’s lower in the stack. It can also generally be observed that the ‘Platform’ for any PP tends to be the PP immediately below in the stack.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The assumptions and security objectives for the OE for the three PP’s in this example map well to each other. There are generally only three categories: Platform Integrity, Proper (Non-Malicious) User and Proper (Trusted) Admin. The virtualization PP considers also Physical Security but this not considered by the other PPs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the context of these PPs, where the assurance level is low (no development security requirements, vulnerability requirements at AVA_VAN.1: public search), the assumptions and Security Objectives for the OE should be sufficiently satisfied by any suitable cloud security certification process recognized by a national government supporting Common Criteria that addresses the environment being used. (e.g. lowest level FedRAMP, BSI C5 baseline, ISO27017).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the PP_GPCP is adopted by vendors for cloud infrastructure, then this could be added to the model since it provides a number of additional assumptions around root-of-trust and supply chain security that could provide additional assurance.</p>
