== {iTC-ITname} Technical Resolution Approvals
The goal of the {iTC-ITname} is to always reach a decision by consensus. That may not always be possible, but even when it is, the process for ensuring the changes are agreed to is handled by setting restrictions on the Interpretation branch in GitHub. 

The table below specifies the approval criteria for accepting a resolution from the {iTC-ITname}.

Within these numbers, the requirements of the ToR such as votes per organization, abstentions, etc., are in effect. 

Approvals that occur through the GitHub approval process are automatically recorded and do not need any external recording or process.
